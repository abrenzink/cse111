Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

Virtual E6B flight computer

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?

My python program is a virtual version of the so know flight computer
that calculates crucial flight information, that guarantees safe flight planning.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

I want to be more confident working with python. If there is enough time, I'd like to deal with GUI in python, and create a more friendly program. 

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)

Math, pytest, random (for testing), tkinter (if there is available time).

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

Yes. Each calculus will be completed by a specific function.

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?

Yes.
