Functions are so powerful because they are reusable. A smae function can be use many times,
with diferent values. It saves a lot of time in the development of any technology.
It also helps us to organize code and make code easier to be updated.

Test functions helps us to know if the objective of the function is beeing achieved.
It is a way of making data processed by the function safer.

has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

While trobleshooting my final project, I have tested many different values to see what
I would get in return. It helped me to knoe how the functions were behaving and 
I could change them and make them more efficient.
